# Commodity Documentation

## Structure

  - `datasheet` and `manuals`  directories are placeholders in case you need the documentation for offline use.
  - `images` contains rendered images with the board from Kicad 3d viewer and photos of the board after it was asm'd at jlcpcb
  - `webench` contains the layers recommented by TI's Webench designer for power sources
